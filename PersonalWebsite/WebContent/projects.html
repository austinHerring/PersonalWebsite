	          <p>
	          	I made this app for a UGA club Volleyball Tournament. Before, they used posters and markers to organize the lineups for each pool. They had to manually record the scores and calculate what rank each team was so that they could be seeded for the bracket later. This inspired me to build something to improve it, and gave me a reason to try out the MEAN Fullstack framework!

	          	An application for Android 6.0+ that keeps tracks of personal goals, allows you to view and encourage friends pursue their goals. The idea of this application is not novel, but it was a great way to get some experience working in both the front and back end of a mini-software engineering project. The code follows MVC patterns.

	          <p>
	          	Pokemon GO is quickly becoming one of the most popular apps. This application serves as a tool to augment a players experience with Pokemon GO. The application (Android 5.0+) was originally made for myself, but then published because it proved quite useful. Its basic function is to calculate how many evolutions a trainer can make with the current amount of candies and Pokemon. The proves useful when trying to evolve as many Pokemon during a Lucky Egg.

	          	This project was done in conjunction with "2" other students (really 1). Many people don't have a clue on what congressional bills are currently being looked at or passed. The project seeks to solve that problem by finding bills relevant to a user based on what he likes. First we scraped the Bills from 1989-present day in the form of text files. Then we generated a Term-Document Matrix using a weighting function rooted in Bayesian probability. Next we used hierarchical support vector machines on the different vectors of the matrix as a way of feature extraction. Lastly, we used Latent Semantic Indexing and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency to create weighted feature vectors that we then ran the hierarchy classifier to gain improved results.features.

	          	Designed a custom Instruction Set Architecture to assemble a simple recursive C code snippet. The assembled instructions are them stored into RAM and executed along my datapath in the circuit schematic. The naive bussed approach and pipelined versions were both implemented. The pipelined version is sweeeeeeet!

	          <p>
	          	This project was done in collaberation with three other students. We wrote our implementation of the travelling salesman problem combining VHDL as our hardware desrciption language and Nios II Assembly language. The DE2 Simple Computer was made mobile by attaching it to a bot. Using a C++ preprocessing algorithm to order a given set of points we were able to hit at least twelve points in 12ft by 8ft grid in under a minute.

	          	with a short, easy run time.
