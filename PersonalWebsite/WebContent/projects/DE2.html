			To make a very long story short, the project consisted of two parts: the preprocessing algorithm and the state machine implemented in assembly. The figure below describes how the greedy algorithm was used to append easily interpreted labels to the assembly code. It sorted the points in the order of visitation so that the whole path was minimal. Obviously the total number of possible paths would be n! given n points. Rather than compute this, we decided to run a rather weak preprocessing algorithm and make up time in an optimized state machine.

        	These graphs show the trajectory of the bot starting from the origin. The left graph of each coupling is the theoretical path generated by the preprocessing code. The right image of each coupling shows the path of the bot in reality clocked at 5 Hertz. The bot performed marginally well with an average error of ~3.78 inches.

  			This is the state machine that the <a href="https://github.com/austinHerring/DE2Bot-TSP">assembly code</a> follows. Keeping the mechanics simple was one of the best ways to reduce compiled error over time.

  			Essentially the bot follows a policy of “point and shoot” where it will first rotate in place, then drive forward to the next place. There are no breaks on the bot so we had to calculate when to accelerate and decelerate. Overshooting was problem that needed to be minimized because it would compound over each iteration. In addition, it impossible for a hardware device to move perfectly linear, so we programmed an adjust adjust subroutine that kept the bot going towards its destination. The image below describes the procedure. This ended up creating a snake-like path that ended up decreasing the time efficiency.
