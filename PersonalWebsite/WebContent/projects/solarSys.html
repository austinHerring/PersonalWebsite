        	This project simply models our solar system in 2D. It keeps all of the plant statistics in ratio including obit speed, planet diameter and distance from the sun's core. The sun is excluded. When the planets orbit in real time, the movements are invisible to the human eye. For this reason I added a feature that speeds up the orbit so that the different planet rates are more apparent. In addition, it was hard to see the plants within the astroid belt because their sizes are so small compared to the outer planets. That is why I added the zoom feature. The source code can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/austinHerring/Solar-System-Simulator">here</a> and ran locally.

			This second figure below shows the simulator zoomed in so that the inner planets can be seen better.

        	 With the amount of experience I had when I made this I thought it was super cool and impressive. However, now I look back and realize how extremely novice it was. It really goes to show how much someone can learn in just a few years. I'm sure that in 5 years I'll look back at my current work and think it was child's play. :) I just thought it would be cool to add my first project to keep things in perspective.
