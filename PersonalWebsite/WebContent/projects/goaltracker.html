        	This project is currently <a href="https://github.com/austinHerring/GoalTracker">under construction</a>. I haven't had much time to work on it with my summer classes going on. I wanted to create this to motivate me to get in shape and amongst other various objective. There are two types of goals in the app. A Streak goal, represented by fire, has the user string their objective for as long as possible at an interval of their choice. A Countdown goal, represented by a checkered flag, has a user perform there objective until a desired termination date, at a custom interval. The idea isn't really novel, but it served as a way for me to learn a lot of new things about software engineering and how the components all work together. It is community based, so user's may have friends, follow their goals, and even track the same goal together and compete.give a taste.

			Firebase is used as a database to store objects as JSON. Google App Engine is used as the backend for the app's notification system which manages the when user's should receive reminders and notifiactions. The architecture of the code is set up as Model-View-Controller. Java is used for the business logic and XML is used as the markup language for the app's aesthetics. Again, its currently being worked on so you cannot get it in the Google play store right now. But I added two pictures to give a taste.
